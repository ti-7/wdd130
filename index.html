        <p>"In comparison to all the U.S. states and territories, Utah, with a population of just over three million, is
            the 13th
            largest by area, the 30th most populous, and the 11th least densely populated.Urban development is mostly
            concentrated in two regions: the Wasatch Front in the north-central part of the state, which
            includes the state capital, Salt Lake City, and is home to roughly two-thirds of the population; and
            Washington County
            in the southwest, which has approximately 180,000 residents.[11] Most of the western half of Utah lies in
            the Great
            Basin."- wikipedia</p>
